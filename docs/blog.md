# Ideal Google Ads Automation Tool

A comprehensive system for automating, auditing, and optimizing Google Ads at scale.

## Audit Section
Our centralized audit console gives you full visibility and control over your account changes:

1. **20â€“40 Built-In Deterministic Rules**
   - A curated library of pre-defined "If this, then that" rules covering budget caps, bid thresholds, pause/resume logic, and more.
   - Examples: Pause campaigns when daily spend exceeds budget; alert if CPA spikes above target; resume paused ads at high-traffic hours.
2. **Rule Builder UI**
   - An intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create custom rules without writing code.
   - Live preview: simulate data over any date range to see potential changes before activation.
   - Scheduling options: run once, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly with flexible lookback windows.
3. **Bulk-Apply & Manager Actions**
   - Apply multiple rules across campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, and asset groups in a single click.
   - Save rule sets as templates for reuse or share them with your team.
4. **Historical Audit Log**
   - Immutable change history: who ran which rule, when, and what actions were taken.
   - Snapshots: view account state before and after each rule execution.
   - Exportable logs for compliance or client reporting.
5. **LLM-Powered Rule Suggestions**
   - AI-driven insights recommend new rules based on account anomalies, performance trends, and seasonal patterns.
   - "What-If" assistant: ask natural-language questions (e.g. "How can I reduce CPA in the last 7 days?") and receive suggested rule configurations.

## Negative-Keywords Page
Easily discover, manage, and enforce negative keyword strategies to eliminate waste:

1. **Auto-Suggest Negatives from Search-Terms Data**
   - Continuous scan of your account's search terms report to identify low-value or irrelevant queries.
   - One-click add: convert suggestions into negatives or review them in a staging queue.
2. **Conflict Detector**
   - Analyze overlaps between negative keywords and active keyword lists to prevent unintended campaign pauses.
   - Visualize conflicts per campaign/ad group with filterable conflict severity levels.
3. **Bulk Import/Export**
   - Download negative lists in CSV or Excel format, edit in your spreadsheet tool, and re-import with a single upload.
   - Versioned negative lists: tag each upload by date and description for easy rollback.
4. **Automated Crystal Ball**
   - Look into the future & predict the impact of your negative keyword changes. The % & absolute change in impr, cost, conv & value.
5. **LLM-Driven Semantic Grouping**
   - AI clusters semantically related negatives into themes (e.g. "free," "jobs," "cheap") for easier bulk management.
   - Natural-language search within your negative library (e.g. "show me brand terms I've excluded").
